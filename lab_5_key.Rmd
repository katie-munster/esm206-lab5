# Confidence Intervals

In this section, we'll learn to use the 't.test()' function as a way to return the confidence interval using the t-distribution.

## Example 1

Create a mock sample of observation values, and find the confidence interval. Then we'll learn how to report that.

```{r}
pika_mass <- c(82, 94, 110, 70, 86, 99, 102, 320, 5000)
# use a representative sample

pika_mean <- mean(pika_mass)

pika_sd <- sd(pika_mass)

pika_ci <- t.test(pika_mass)

# type pika_ci in console to see it
# degrees of freedom is sample size - 1

pika_ci
# never just return this. this is not an acceptable way to report any summary of anything
```


### Risky & tedious way:

Mean pika mass at Paiute Pass is 91.9 g $\pm$ 13.5 g (mean $\pm$ 1 standard deviation, n = 7)
 with a 95% confidence interval of [79.4, 104.4] g.
- prone to human error. manually writing in things is bad.
- also tedious, ie. if we added one more pika mass and data changed.
- not reproducible

### A high initial investment, but safer & better way:

In-line code referencing to stored objects!

Use a single backtick on either side of a lowercase r to create an in-line bit of code. Backtick is under the ~ on the keyboard; not an apostrophe.

Mean pika mass at Paiute Pass is `r mean(pika_mass)`

Mean pika mass at Paiute Pass is `r pika_mean`

Mean pika mass at Paiute Pass is `r round(pika_mean, 1)` g $\pm$ `r round(pika_sd, 1)` g (mean $\pm$ 1 standard deviation, n = `r length(pika_mass)`) with a 95% confidence interval of [`r round(pika_ci$conf.int[1], 1)`, `r round(pika_ci$conf.int[2], 1)`] g.

```{r}
# my_list$name
# my_list$age
# use $ to refer to elements in a list, the same way we would for columns of a dataframe
# ?t.test in console for more information
# pika_ci$p.value returns the p-value
# pika_ci$estimate returns the mean value

# pika_ci$conf.int

# pika_mass
# pika_mass[2] returns the second element of the vector. not 0 based like Python

# my_list$name[2]
```

# Two-sample t-test

Use a two-sample t-test to test the null hypothesis that samples were drawn from populations with the same mean (difference in means = 0).

- H0: Means difference = 0
- HA: Means difference is NOT = 0

This is a two-sided t-test beecause no directionality is implied.

## Example 1

```{r}
oak_trees <- c(29, 19, 22, 30, 35, 16, 20, 7)
  
pine_trees <- c(48, 32, 41, 40, 56, 70, 30, 19, 20)
```

Is there a significant difference in mean heights for oak and pine trees?

```{r}
trees_t <- t.test(oak_trees, pine_trees)
```

The p-value of `r trees_t$p.value` means that there is `r (trees_t$p.value) * 100`% chance of finding sample means *at least as different as those I found* by random chance if they were drawn from populations with the same mean height.

I would reject the null hypothesis
