# Confidence Intervals

In this section, we'll learn to use the 't.test()' function as a way to return the confidence interval using the t-distribution.

## Example 1

Create a mock sample of observation values, and find the confidence interval. Then we'll learn how to report that.

```{r}
pika_mass <- c(82, 94, 110, 70, 86, 99, 102, 320, 5000)
# use a representative sample

pika_mean <- mean(pika_mass)

pika_sd <- sd(pika_mass)

pika_ci <- t.test(pika_mass)

# type pika_ci in console to see it
# degrees of freedom is sample size - 1

pika_ci
# never just return this. this is not an acceptable way to report any summary of anything
```


### Risky & tedious way:

Mean pika mass at Paiute Pass is 91.9 g $\pm$ 13.5 g (mean $\pm$ 1 standard deviation, n = 7)
 with a 95% confidence interval of [79.4, 104.4] g.
- prone to human error. manually writing in things is bad.
- also tedious, ie. if we added one more pika mass and data changed.
- not reproducible

### A high initial investment, but safer & better way:

In-line code referencing to stored objects!

Use a single backtick on either side of a lowercase r to create an in-line bit of code. Backtick is under the ~ on the keyboard; not an apostrophe.

Mean pika mass at Paiute Pass is `r mean(pika_mass)`

Mean pika mass at Paiute Pass is `r pika_mean`

Mean pika mass at Paiute Pass is `r round(pika_mean, 1)` g $\pm$ `r round(pika_sd, 1)` g (mean $\pm$ 1 standard deviation, n = `r length(pika_mass)`) with a 95% confidence interval of [`r round(pika_ci$conf.int[1], 1)`, `r round(pika_ci$conf.int[2], 1)`] g.

```{r}
# my_list$name
# my_list$age
# use $ to refer to elements in a list, the same way we would for columns of a dataframe
# ?t.test in console for more information
# pika_ci$p.value returns the p-value
# pika_ci$estimate returns the mean value

# pika_ci$conf.int

# pika_mass
# pika_mass[2] returns the second element of the vector. not 0 based like Python

# my_list$name[2]
```

# Two-sample t-test

Use a two-sample t-test to test the null hypothesis that samples were drawn from populations with the same mean (difference in means = 0).

- H0: Means difference = 0
- HA: Means difference is NOT = 0

This is a two-sided t-test beecause no directionality is implied.

## Example 1

```{r}
oak_trees <- c(29, 19, 22, 30, 35, 16, 20, 7)
  
pine_trees <- c(48, 32, 41, 40, 56, 70, 30, 19, 20)
```

Is there a significant difference in mean heights for oak and pine trees?

```{r}
trees_t <- t.test(oak_trees, pine_trees)
```

The p-value of `r trees_t$p.value` means that there is `r (trees_t$p.value) * 100`% chance of finding sample means *at least as different as those I found* by random chance if they were drawn from populations with the same mean height.

I would reject the null hypothesis


## Example 2

Using the `mpg` dataset to compare city gas mileage for SUVs and compact cars.

```{r}
# In console, use unique(mpg$class) to see all the classes in that column

# Create a subset called compact_suv that only contains observations where the class is suv OR compact

compact_suv <- mpg %>% 
  filter(class %in% c("compact", "suv"))
# In console, run unique(compact_suv$class) to run a check on this.
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = compact_suv, aes(x = cty)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 12) +
  facet_wrap(~ class)

# both of these graphs, look relatively normally distributed. no concerns
# this is exploratory

# Do you think assumptions of normality make sense?
# I think means is an appropriate method of central tendancy (?)


ggplot(data = compact_suv, aes(sample = cty)) +
  geom_qq() +
  facet_wrap(~ class)
# the more divergent from linear, the more evidence that this is not from a normal distribution
# here, there is nothing ridiculous skewed that would justify not doing a t test
# qq plot should only be used in combination with histograms, etc.

# these are exploratory plots. means make sense to compare these two plots
```


```{r}
# make a summary table:
car_stats <- compact_suv %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarize(mean_city = mean(cty),
            sd_city = round(sd(cty), 1),
            sample_size = n())

car_stats

# if you were printing this in document, update column headers to contain units. do rounding. etc.
```


```{r}
compact_sample <- compact_suv %>% 
  filter(class == "compact") %>% 
  pull(cty)

suv_sample <- compact_suv %>% 
  filter(class == "suv") %>% 
  pull (cty)

cars_t <- t.test(compact_sample, suv_sample)
# look at cars_t in the console

# p-value is very small. There is a neglible probability that these samples were drawn from populations of the same mean.
```

stats speak: reject the null hypothesis of equal mean city gas mileages

paper: Mean gas mileage for compact cars and SUVs differs significantly (t(`r cars_t$parameter`) = `r cars_t$statistic`, p < 0.001, $\alpha$ = 0.05).
